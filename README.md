# Namu Makwembo Portifolio

Tall-Stack ❤️


Hi there! , My name is Namu Makwembo and i am a programming enthusiast , i started my coding journey back in 2011 when i wrote my first C# speech to text app, 
I was  amazed by how I could  easily &  naturally understandd Algorithms and code , fast forward to 2019 i started my journey as a PHP web developer  which i enjoyed 
, Ever since i have been learning and advancing my skills as a web developer ,for that reason it is safe to say that i now consider myself to be an expert in
problem solving because no matter how big a problem is or how long it takes me to solve an algorithmic problem
i always end up solving it.

As a PHP developer i specialize in the  
<a class="cursor-pointer underline hover:text-blue-500" href="https://laravel.com/">Laravel PHP framework</a>, which is one of the best things that has ever happened to me as a web developer,
Including
<a class="cursor-pointer underline hover:text-blue-500" href="https://laravel-livewire.com/">Livewire</a>,
<a class="cursor-pointer underline hover:text-blue-500" href="https://alpinejs.dev/">Alpine</a>, and
<a class="cursor-pointer underline hover:text-blue-500" href="https://tailwindcss.com/">Tailwind CSS</a> hence

I can do a lot of internet magic with these 4 stacks, Which also makes me a Full-stack web developer.
